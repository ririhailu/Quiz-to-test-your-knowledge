# Quiz-to-test-your-knowledge

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create a quiz application using JavaScript. The quiz contains multiple choice questions and can store the user's top scores. When taking the quiz and user clicks start, it will penalize seconds for every incorrect answer. The final score is determined by the remaining number of seconds on the timer. The user will enter their initials to add their score to the high score list. Once, their information is entered, they have an option to clear or restart the quiz.
